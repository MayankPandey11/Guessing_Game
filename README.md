# Guessing_Game

# Only us Javascript

This game is fairly simple: the computer thinks of a number between 1 and Maximum No , and the user needs to guess what it is. The user can make a guess, and depending on the guess, the computer may tell the user either “my number is smaller”, “my number is bigger” or “correct number!”
